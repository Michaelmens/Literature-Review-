Abstract = {To assess the environmental impact of wastewater treatment, life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is a frequently applied instrument. However, these
   studies often require large amounts of data. The complexity and
   heterogeneity of these data result in the need for a systematic data
   management approach. Especially the generation of the life cycle
   inventory (LCI) holds the potential to be facilitated by automation. A
   case study in the wastewater sector was used to demonstrate the
   implementation of data management. A database structure was developed to
   store the raw data of the wastewater plants (WWTPs) and make it
   accessible through code. The code interacted with the database,
   implemented calculations, and automatically created the inventory based
   on the processed data. The database provides a consistent structure for
   the raw data and can also be used for backup purposes. Because it is
   machine-readable it can be accessed through the code that enables the
   automated generation of the LCI. As a proof of concept, a sequence of
   the code is provided with a user interface and can be tested online. We
   found that for most use cases, basic programming tools were sufficient
   for systematic data management, and, therefore, the approach is
   considered accessible for LCA practitioners.},

Title = {Semantic catalogs for life cycle assessment data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {1109-1117},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a highly interdisciplinary field that
   requires knowledge from different domains to be gathered and interpreted
   together. Although there are relatively few major data sources for LCA,
   the data themselves are presented with highly heterogeneous formats,
   interfaces, and distribution mechanisms. The lack of agreement among
   data providers for descriptions of processes and flows creates
   substantial barriers for information sharing and reuse of practitioners'
   models.
   Nevertheless, the many data resources share a common logic. The use of
   Semantic Web technologies and text mining techniques can facilitate the
   interpretation of data from diverse sources. Numerous existing efforts
   have been made to articulate a knowledge model for LCA. In March of 2015
   a joint workshop was held that brought together leading international
   domain experts with ontology engineers to develop a set of simple models
   called ontology design patterns (ODPs) for LCA information. In this
   paper we build on the outcomes of the workshop, as well as prior
   published works, to derive a minimal ``consensus model{''} for LCA. We
   use the consensus model to derive a description of an LCA ``catalog{''}
   that can be used to express the semantic content of a data resource. We
   generate catalogs of several prominent databases, and make those
   catalogs available to the public for independent use. Finally, we
   ``link{''} those catalogs to existing knowledge models using JSON-LD, a
   linked data format that can expose the catalog contents to Semantic Web
   tools.
   We then show by example how the catalogs may be used to answer questions
   about the scope, coverage, and comparability of data, both within and
   across data sources, that are difficult to answer when the contents of
   the catalogs are provided independently and inconsistently. We discuss
   how the use of semantic catalogs can help address challenges that
   initiatives such as the ``Global Network of Interoperable LCA Databases
   Global LCA Data Access{''} are facing today. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) regionalization (i.e., the determination of
   input and output flows from production processes at a subcountry scale)
   is a priority in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, particularly in
   the agri-food sector. Many regionalized LCAs fail to ensure that
   microlevel inventories are consistent with country-level aggregated
   data-or ``scale consistent.{''} They also fail to construct LCIs using
   international reference guidelines and trustworthy standardized data
   sources. This failure generates inaccuracies and biases in inventories
   and can compromise comparability among international LCA studies. Our
   study introduces scale consistency as a principle for regionalized
   agri-food LCIs. We present a generic procedure that defines how
   scale-dependent LCI flows should be regionalized, depending on data
   availability. We then present a list of inventory flows that require
   regionalization and their suggested calculation procedures (methods and
   models) from 2 methodological guides developed by projects Agribalyse
   and World Food LCA Database. As proof of concept, we apply the procedure
   to Portugal and assess whether the methods and models proposed for each
   type of inventory flow in both guides can potentially be applied
   consistently with the data available. For 17 inventory flows, we apply
   calculated scale-consistent inventory flows for Portuguese agriculture,
   covering 260 products that can be used in future LCA studies. Comparing
   results with international databases, we show that this procedure can
   improve country-level estimates significantly. Our study is the first
   step in introducing scale consistency as a guiding principle for
   regionalized LCIs for agri-food LCA studies. (C) 2017 SETAC},

Abstract = {Energy-saving and emission-reduction (ESER), carbon footprint, carbon
   labeling, and carbon trading have attracted much attention recently due
   to severe environmental challenges. One key technology for implementing
   the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative
   evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation
   technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the
   existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from
   the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource
   planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship
   management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise
   information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for
   ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and
   bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered
   structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and
   application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and
   presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each
   layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the
   proposed method. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1)
   facilitate real-time intelligent perception, and the collection of
   energy consumption and environmental impact data generated in the entire
   life cycle of manufacturing by using IoT technologies; and 2) realize
   effective data integration between the ESER evaluation system and the
   existing enterprise information systems based on BOM.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {As construction costs continue to rise and adequate amounts of funding
   continues to be a challenge, the allocation of resources is of critical
   importance when it comes to the maintenance and rehabilitation (M\&R) of
   highway infrastructure. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is
   presented here that integrates realistic traffic conditions in the
   operational phase to compare M\&R scenarios over the analysis period of
   a 26-km stretch of Interstate-495. Pavement International Roughness
   Index (IRI) were determined using American Association of State Highway
   and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) PavementME System. Meanwhile,
   vehicle fuel consumption and emission factors were calculated using a
   combination of Google Maps((R)), the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator, the second
   Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study,
   and MassDOT's Transportation Data Management System. The evaluation of
   pavement performance with realistic traffic conditions, varying M\&R
   strategies, and material characteristics was quantified in terms of Life
   Cycle Cost (LCC), Global Warming Potential (GWP), and Cumulative Energy
   Demand (CED) for both agencies and users. The inclusion of realistic
   traffic conditions into the use phase of the LCA resulted in a 6.4\%
   increase in CED and GWP when compared to baseline conditions simulated
   for a week long operation duration. Results from this study show that
   optimization of M\&R type, material selection, and timing may lead to a
   2.72\% decrease in operations cost and 47.6\% decrease in construction
   and maintenance costs.},

Title = {The population equivalent as a novel approach for life cycle assessment
   of cities and inter-city comparisons},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {1623-1647},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose Since the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development was set,
   cities are gaining momentum in the sustainability debate as favorable
   hubs of interventions to implement environmentally friendly policies.
   What makes a city sustainable is still object of debate though, as
   standards, frameworks, and methodologies with different goals and scope
   proliferate. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is promising in supporting
   cities to achieve this ambitious task, but methodological constraints
   still exist to make it applicable at city scale. This study offers
   proposals to solve current bottlenecks in the goal and scope phase for
   the application of LCA to urban systems and allowing for a meaningful
   inter-city comparison and benchmarking. Methods In order to define
   cities along with their function(s) and functional unit, a systematic
   desk study combined with authors' knowledge is performed and tested on
   the city of Leuven (Belgium). The final outcome includes the following:
   (i) categorization of cities based on their (prevalent) function(s);
   (ii) sets of indicators able to support both urban policies and LCA
   studies; and (iii) accounting and use of the population equivalent
   concept, as innovative and enhanced functional unit able to summarize
   and normalize different entities (i.e., residents and other city-users)
   to one single metric. Results and discussion Despite the fervent debate
   about cities and their sustainability, few studies address the topic of
   categorization and benchmarking of cities in an exhaustive way. The
   proposals were successfully applied to the city of Leuven, as first case
   study, with different degrees of extent and quality. A shortlist of five
   biophysical and economic criteria combined with ten urban categories
   represents a first straightforward tier of categorization. The
   population equivalent has the triple function of being descriptive,
   quantitative, and analytical for performing thorough urban
   sustainability studies and define targeted policies, but requires high
   computational and data collection efforts. The quality and granularity
   of collected information proved to be directly proportional to the
   access of local data sources, and inversely to its complexity, i.e.,
   sufficient for policy support, but improvable when the goal is to
   perform LCA studies. Conclusions The functional categorization of cities
   and the calculation of the population equivalent provide a new approach
   for meaningful and helpful inter-city comparisons, as well as an
   enhanced detection and interpretation of urban environmental burdens.
   Due to the relevance of the topic in the scientific debate, the authors
   envisage complementary and multidisciplinary studies to make cities more
   and more part of the solution to the sustainability challenge,
   especially to improve the concept of population equivalent and the data
   management.},

Title = {A Modular Tool to Support Data Management for LCA in Industry:
   Methodology, Application and Potentialities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) computes potential environmental impacts of
   a product or process. However, LCAs in the industrial sector are
   generally delivered through static yearly analyses which cannot capture
   any temporal dynamics of inventory data. Moreover, LCA must deal with
   differences across background models, Life Cycle Impact Assessment
   (LCIA) methods and specific rules of environmental labels, together with
   their developments over time and the difficulty of the non-expert
   organization staff to effectively interpret LCA results. A case study
   which discusses how to manage these barriers and their relevance is
   currently lacking. Here, we fill this gap by proposing a general
   methodology to develop a modular tool which integrates spreadsheets, LCA
   software, coding and visualization modules that can be independently
   modified while leaving the architecture unchanged. We test the tool
   within the ORI Martin secondary steelmaking plant, finding that it can
   manage (i) a high amount of primary foreground data to build a dynamic
   LCA; (ii) different background models, LCIA methods and environmental
   labels rules; (iii) interactive visualizations. Then, we outline the
   relevance of these capabilities since (i) temporal dynamics of
   foreground inventory data affect monthly LCA results, which may vary by
   +/- 14\% around the yearly value; (ii) background datasets, LCIA methods
   and environmental label rules may alter LCA results by 20\%; (iii) more
   than 10(5) LCA values can be clearly visualized through dynamically
   updated dashboards. Our work paves the way towards near-real-time LCA
   monitoring of single product batches, while contextualizing the company
   sustainability targets within global environmental trends.},

Title = {Embodied carbon assessment of residential housing at urban scale},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A great majority of the previous research put extensive efforts on the
   evaluation of life cycle impacts and carbon footprint of single
   buildings. Analysis on single buildings often excludes components
   related with urban scale such as construction of infrastructure,
   distance to city centre and transportation. Research on
   neighbourhood-scale settlements is necessary to further develop the
   understanding of the environmental impact of built-environment.
   This study aims to develop a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework for
   the embodied carbon assessment of the built environment at neighbourhood
   scale. The study validates the results on three neighbourhood-scale mass
   housing projects in Ankara, Turkey. Embodied carbon assessment of these
   projects were conducted in order to generate a reference model of
   mass-housing projects. A data management framework for carbon assessment
   was also provided in the study.
   According to the results, an average of 409.2 kg(CO2-eq)/m(2) originated
   at the neighbourhood level including emissions from the buildings,
   structural landscape and transportation infrastructure. Buildings
   contribute 272.4 kg(CO2-eq/m2), which comprise 66.6\% of the total
   emissions. On the other hand, 37.4 kg(CO2-eq/m2) (9.1\%) originate from
   structural landscape and 99.4 kg(CO2-eq/m2) (24.3\%) originate from
   transportation infrastructure. The results reveal the necessity to widen
   the assessment boundaries when investigating embedded carbon in larger
   scale built environment for fairer results.
   The outputs of the model may yield valuable inputs for designers and
   urban planners throughout their decision-making processes.},

Title = {A comprehensive planetary boundary-based method for the nitrogen cycle
   in life cycle assessment: Development and application to a tomato
   production case study},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {715},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Existing methods that apply the planetary boundaiy for the nitrogen
   cycle in life cycle assessment are spatially generic and use an
   indicator with limited environmental relevance. Here, we develop a
   spatially resolved method that can quantify the impact of nitrogen
   emissions to air, soil, freshwater or coastal water on ``safe operating
   space{''} (SOS) for natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The
   method can be used to identify potential ``planetary boundary
   hotspots{''} in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate
   interventions. The method is based on a coupling of existing
   environmental models and the identification of threshold and reference
   values in natural soil, freshwater and coastal water.
   The method is demonstrated for a case study on nitrogen emissions from
   open-field tomato production in 27 farming areas based on data for 199
   farms in the year 2014. Nitrogen emissions were modelled from farm-level
   data on fertilizer application, fuel consumption and dimate- and soil
   conditions. Two sharing principles, ``status quo{''} and ``gross value
   added{''}, were tested for the assignment of SOS to 1 t of tomatoes.
   The coupling of models and identification of threshold and reference
   values resulted in spatially resolved characterization factors
   applicable to any nitrogen emission and estimations of SOS for each
   environmental compartment. In the case study, tomato production was
   found to range from not transgressing to transgressing its assigned SOS
   in each of the 27 farming areas, depending on the receiving compartment
   and sharing principle. A high nitrogen use efficiency scenario had the
   potential to reverse transgressions of assigned SOS for up to three
   farming locations.
   Despite of several sources of uncertainty, the developed method may be
   used in decision-support by stakeholders, ranging from individual
   producers to global governance institutions. To avoid sub-optimization,
   it should be applied with methods covering the other planetary
   boundaries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the sustainability of Spanish cities considering environmental
   and socio-economic indicators},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {599-610},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The conception of urban metabolism has considered the perspective of
   environmental sustainability in the framework of cities. In this
   context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and
   energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of
   waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress.
   According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and
   economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning
   processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and
   development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of
   indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this
   paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies:
   Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data
   Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of
   26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e.,
   population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The
   combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities
   considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of
   sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented
   in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an
   efficiency score lower than 100\% defined as non-sustainable ones.
   Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for
   the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives
   for the non sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable
   performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities
   that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9\% to 85.8\%.
   According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should
   be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion),
   unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of
   electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse
   gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective. These
   outcomes are of potential interest for politicians, governments and
   inhabitants to aid in the identification of the metabolic flows and
   social/economic indicators to be optimized in search of sustainability.

Title = {The evolution of the carbon footprint of Dutch raw milk production

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The development of the carbon footprint (CF) of raw cow milk over time
   has been scarcely researched. The objectives of this study are (1) to
   determine the annual raw cow milk CF in the Netherlands between 1990 and
   2019 and (2) to identify the factors explaining the development of the
   raw cow milk CF over time. We applied Life Cycle Assessment (cradle to
   farm gate) to the average Dutch dairy system and used data collected
   from national statistics and from the farm accountancy data network.The
   CF of raw cow milk produced in the Netherlands in 2019 was 992 g CO2-eq.
   per kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM), while in 1990 it was 1522
   g CO2-eq. (kg FPCM)-1. This represents a reduction of 35\%. The
   reduction rate of the CF is affected by the scope of the CF study, i.e.
   reduction rate is smaller if direct land use change (dLUC) (32\%) and
   soil organic carbon (SOC) balance (29\%) are included in the total CF.
   Methodological choices affect the absolute level of the CF by up to
   27\%, but the impact on the reduction rate over time is negligible. The
   results show that continuous improvement in agricultural practices
   (increased milk and roughage yields, improved feed efficiency and
   decreased nitrogen application) has played an important role in reducing
   the CF of milk over the years. Along with this process, the Dutch dairy
   system has evolved into less grazing and less land devoted to permanent
   grasslands which decreased carbon sequestration. In order to achieve
   climate targets, the annual reduction rate needs to be increased and
   additional efforts are required if the Dutch dairy sector is to play its
   part in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Special attention is
   needed for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from enteric
   fermentation and manure storage. However, the main challenge for the
   future is to find a balanced set of measures to integrally reduce all
   the sources of GHG emission within the carbon footprint of milk.},

Abstract = {AimThe purpose of this study is to assess the status quo of data sharing
   in LCA in relation to the FAIR (findability, accessibility,
   interoperability, and reuse) data principles.MethodsThis study
   investigates how is LCA data from publicly funded research currently
   shared. Firstly, the focus is on life cycle inventory data shared in
   journal articles. Given that FAIR data sharing is not only the
   responsibility of the LCA practitioner, this study further investigates
   guidelines (e.g., data sharing standards and data management plans) and
   infrastructure (repositories, data formats, and nomenclature) to
   identify the tools and services available to LCA community which are
   essential to enable FAIR data sharing.ResultsThe study identifies that
   although there is growing awareness to improve data sharing practices,
   implementation of FAIR guidelines for data sharing is seldom seen in
   practice. LCA studies that adhere to FAIR principles are primarily due
   to use of generic data repositories which provide tools to support data
   sharing. However, there is no guidance on how LCA specific data should
   be shared to ensure its findability, accessibility, interoperability,
   and reusability. This study suggests a workflow to enable FAIRification
   of LCA data. In addition, the study recommends further efforts within
   the LCA community on skill and technology development, strategic
   funding, and recognition of the best practices in relation to data
   sharing.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study highlights the necessity of
   data sharing incentives, guidelines, and platforms/repositories specific
   for the LCA community.},

Title = {Developing a new data-driven LCA tool at the urban scale: The case of
   the energy performance of the building sector},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {256},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Given the ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets set by
   the European Union and the importance of cities in achieving these
   goals, there is an increasing need to analyze their environmental
   footprint with a life cycle approach. The life cycle assessment is
   considered the leading methodology for environmental metrics, permitting
   a holistic environmental perspective of cities. Developing a complete
   life cycle assessment can be difficult and time-consuming, particularly
   discouraging to non-experts. Life cycle assessment software applications
   are aimed at single product evaluation, making urban scale data
   management and environmental assessment complicated or impractical. The
   novelty of this work is a new tool, utilizing a data-driven approach,
   that allows an extensive environmental evaluation of buildings (of the
   operational phase). The tool expands the application of the life cycle
   assessment method at the urban scale where the existing software
   applications are not specifically designed to be implemented and fail
   mainly due to the massive data processing. The tool was applied to
   analyze the city of Milan. Approximately 81,000 building units and
   161,935 energy systems were investigated and compared using ecoinvent
   3.7 as a secondary database and the Environmental Footprint 3.0 method.
   The results show that the space heating service is the main contributor
   to the climate change impact category, followed by domestic hot water
   and space cooling (41.70, 6.50, and 5.92 kgCO(2)eq/m(2) year,
   respectively). Of practical relevance, no scientific research has ever
   been carried out on a plurality of buildings and energy systems at an
   urban scale. Thus, the article's novelty can also be traced to the
   innovative outcomes obtained by testing the tool on the city of Milan.
   Additionally, the tool can be used to establish reliable environmental
   benchmarks to implement policies for buildings and assess the
   environmental footprint of energy requalification initiatives.},

Title = {Balancing farm profit and greenhouse gas emissions along the dairy
   production chain through breeding indices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {451},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Breeding is a promising greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option for the
   dairy sector that offers potential permanent and cumulative effects.
   However, there is limited understanding of how genetic traits affect GHG
   emissions from the dairy production chain and how breeding indices could
   be used to find a balance between GHG emissions and farm profit. Using a
   typical Chinese dairy farm as a case study, we developed a novel method
   to address these gaps. The farm comprised of 1523 Holstein-Friesian
   dairy cows and 1429 young stock. The average milk yield at the farm was
   11,533 kg per cow per year. Life cycle assessment was combined with an
   existing bio-economic model to determine the emission intensity values
   (IV) of six genetic traits: milk yield, protein yield, fat yield,
   calving interval, productive life, and incidence of clinical mastitis.
   The IVs and economic values of the traits were used to form different
   breeding indices, of which the economic and environmental consequences
   were assessed. Results showed that for the next generation, breeding
   animals with optimal indices could reduce carbon dioxide equivalents per
   ton of fat-and-protein-corrected milk by six to 10 kg, while increasing
   profitability by 822 to 1355 Chinese Yuan per cow unit. Different
   indices can balance farm profit and GHG emissions to different degrees.
   However, the indices with higher profit showed less potential in
   reducing GHG emissions. This study provides insights into how breeding
   strategies could contribute to GHG mitigation in the dairy sector.},

Title = {The implementation of organizational LCA to internally manage the

   cosmetics, fragrances, and toiletry provider},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper presents the implementation of O-LCA by a Brazilian
   cosmetics manufacturer. The case study was developed within the
   framework of the road testing of the Guidance on organizational LCA of
   the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. The aim is to illustrate
   methodological choices and implementation challenges encountered by the
   company, i.e., related to the broad product portfolio. The study
   demonstrates that O-LCA allows quantifying and managing environmental
   impacts throughout global supply chains and for every individual
   product.MethodsO-LCA provides the methodological framework for applying
   LCA to organizations, and a set of application options based on the
   structure and experience of organizations. The reporting organization is
   NATURA Brazil in 2013. The 2600 products in the portfolio are modeled in
   this first exercise of the company through the bestsellers at each of
   its ten product category groups. A hybrid approach is considered for
   data collection: top-down approach for modeling corporate activities and
   bottom-up approach for upstream and downstream life cycle phases. The
   data sources are NATURA's recordings, data gathered from suppliers,
   estimates from mass and energy balances, and life cycle inventory
   databases. The approach to acquire direct data or use life cycle
   databases depends on the representativeness of each raw material or
   packaging.Results and discussionThe results show that major impacts
   could be detected during use phase that demands water and energy to use
   rinse-off products (the use phase of NATURA's products contributed over
   41\% to most impact categories), and in the supply chain, and generated
   during the obtaining of plant origin ingredients and materials for
   packaging. Overall, the whole NATURA had in 2013 a potential impact on
   climate change of 1.4 million tonnes of CO2 eq, a natural land
   transformation of 1.3 million m(2), and a fossil depletion of 0.23
   million tonnes of oil eq, among other impacts. Apart from the results at
   the organizational level, individual results for product bestsellers
   were calculated and are presented here.ConclusionsThe study confirmed
   the applicability of the O-LCA model at NATURA, addressed operational
   issues related to broad product portfolios, considering several
   dimensions such as data quality and availability, LCA software, and data
   management. Despite NATURA's existing practices and previous knowledge
   in modeling environmental impacts of products and corporate activities,
   managing the large amount of data involved prove being a complex task.
   The company identified gaps and opportunities able to guide future
   method implementation and LCA-based management.},

Abstract = {Existing tools for environmental certification of buildings are failing
   in their ability to reach the general public and to create social
   awareness, since they require not only specialized knowledge regarding
   construction and energy sources, but also environmental knowledge. In
   this paper, an open-source online tool for the estimation of the carbon
   footprint of residential buildings by non-specialized users is presented
   as a product from the OERCO2 Erasmus + project. The internal
   calculations, data management and operation of this tool are extensively
   explained. The ten most common building typologies built in the last
   decade in Spain are analysed by using the OERCO2 tool, and the order of
   magnitude of the results is analysed by comparing them to the ranges
   determined by other authors. The OERCO2 tool proves itself to be
   reliable, with its results falling within the defined logical value
   ranges. Moreover, the major simplification of the interface allows
   non-specialized users to evaluate the sustainability of buildings.
   Further research is oriented towards its inclusion in other
   environmental certification tools and in Building Information Modeling

Title = {Using the product environmental footprint for supply chain management:
   lessons learned from a case study on pork},

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the chain-organization
   environmental footprint (chain-OEF) approach by applying it to part of a
   pork production chain in Belgium. The approach is supposed to provide
   insight into the environmental impact of a specific production chain in
   an efficient manner by applying pragmatic data collection throughout the
   chain. This is achieved by allocating the environmental impact of each
   of the production sites to the product of interest using straightforward
   allocation rules.
   The cradle-to-gate (up to retail) environmental impact of pork was
   determined by life cycle assessment (LCA), in line with the product and
   organisation environmental footprint guidelines (PEF and OEF; European
   Commission 2013b). Foreground data was gathered at a feed production
   site, two farmers, a slaughterhouse and a meat processing site. All
   foreground operations are part of the same pork production chain in
   Belgium. The chain was completed using background data from Ecoinvent
   v3.01 (Wernet et al. 2016), Agri-Footprint v1.0 (Blonk 2014), European
   Life Cycle Database v3.0, LCA Food Database (Nielsen et al. 2003) and
   OEF Sector Rules Retail (Humbert et al. 2015b). The impact was
   quantified using the international reference life cycle data system
   (ILCD) midpoint method for 14 impact categories, but focussing on
   climate change.
   The total carbon footprint of the cradle-to-gate pork production system
   equals 0.46 kg CO2-eq. (100 g pork)(-1). This result is quite similar to
   that of earlier studies analysing the pork production chain: 0.58 and
   0.57 kg CO2-eq. (100 g pork)(-1) (Bracquen, et al. 2011, Agri-Footprint
   2014). Most of the carbon footprint was caused by feed production and
   more specifically, by the feed ingredients and their transport. Grains,
   soy and palm oil have the largest impact contributions. The farms are
   responsible for most of the remaining impact. N2O and CH4 emissions are
   the largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions at the farms. Also, in the
   other 13 considered impact categories, feed production and farming are
   responsible for more than half of the total impact, mostly followed by
   meat processing.
   Applying the chain-OEF approach in this study has shown that a chain LCA
   can be performed successfully and pragmatic data collection allows
   obtaining LCA results relatively fast, especially for small or

   an issue, the main bottlenecks identified are data management and the

Title = {A life-cycle energy and carbon analysis of hemp-lime bio-composite
   building materials},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {293-305},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Conventional, concrete-based building materials have a high level of
   embodied energy in their production - as do typical insulation
   materials, which are crucial for addressing operational energy demands
   for building climatization. Here, a life-cycle energy (LCEA) and carbon
   (LCCO(2)A) analysis is performed, to evaluate the potential benefits of
   using an alternative, bio-composite building material made from hemp
   shives mixed with a lime binder, in the context of an arid environment.
   The physical properties and thermal performance of the hemp-lime
   building material are compared with conventional materials through lab
   tests, temperature measurements in test cells and thermal simulations.
   This study concludes that hemp-lime not only has a clear advantage over
   comparable conventional materials in terms of embodied energy, but also
   in terms of net CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle of a typical
   building. This is primarily due to the active carbon sequestration of
   the hemp plant during its growing phase, and the gradual sequestration
   of carbon emitted during the production of lime. The thermal properties
   and behaviour of a hemp-lime wall material were found experimentally to
   be virtually identical to those of a commonly-used lightweight concrete
   insulation material with a similar density. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries are eager to strive
   toward innovative products and technologies. This study first derives
   hotspots in resource consumption of 2839 Basic Operations in 40 Active
   Pharmaceutical Ingredient synthesis steps through Exergetic Life Cycle
   Assessment (ELCA). Second, since companies are increasingly obliged to
   quantify the environmental sustainability of their products, two
   alternative ways of simplifying (E)LCA are discussed. The usage of
   averaged product group values (R-2 = 3.40 x 10(-30)) is compared with
   multiple linear regression models (R-2 = 8.66 x 10(-01)) in order to
   estimate resource consumption of synthesis steps. An optimal set of
   predictor variables is postulated to balance model complexity and
   embedded information with usability and capability of merging models
   with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data systems. The
   amount of organic solvents used, molar efficiency, and duration of a
   synthesis step were shown to be the most significant predictor
   variables. Including additional predictor variables did not contribute
   to the predictive power and eventually weakens the model interpretation.
   Ideally, an organization should be able to derive its environmental
   impact from readily available ERP data, linking supply chains back to
   the cradle of resource extraction, excluding the need for an
   approximation with product group averages.},

Title = {A model to assess the environmental and economic impacts of municipal
   waste management in Europe},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {605-617},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The Monitoring Framework proposed in the EU27 New Circular Economy
   Action Plan comprises two mass-based indicators, namely overall
   recycling rate and recycling rate for specific waste streams. Yet, to
   monitor and assess the impacts of circular economy, indicators cannot be
   limited to mass-based indicators; we argue assessments should also
   include environmental and economic effects. Towards this end, these
   impacts can be quantified by an advanced model based on life cycle
   thinking, entailing the use of life cycle assessment and costing
   (LCA/LCC). Calculating these effects for municipal waste management is
   challenging due to gaps in available data for estimating generated
   waste. We propose a methodology to estimate more finely the amounts of
   waste generated in the Member States, complemented with LCA/LCC. The
   results highlight that important inconsistencies in municipal waste data
   reporting exist and that recycling rates calculated from these are lower
   than hitherto estimated. The impacts quantification shows great
   performance variation across EU27, with C-footprint ranging from-490 to
   539 kg CO2-eq. t-1. Potentials for improvement are substantial and can
   bring up to 103 Mt CO2-eq. additional annual saving, reducing costs
   (calculated as Full Environmental LCC) of waste management by 8.4
   billion EUR and bringing 206,100 new jobs in the sector. The approach
   presented highlights the rationale for improved data management on waste
   statistics and the potential for harmonised models. It also paves the
   way for more sophisticated impact analyses relevant for policymaking, by
   bringing a richer perspective to the environ-mental and economic impacts
   of waste management on top of tracking generated, collected and recycled
   waste flows.},

Title = {Building the `Bio-factory': A bibliometric analysis of circular
   economies and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in wastewater
   treatment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {323},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The ``Biofactory{''} is a circular economy-based concept for wastewater
   treatment that improves water quality, promotes efficient use of
   materials and energy, while also recovering resources and decreasing
   both emissions and costs. Due to socio-economic bottlenecks, such as
   typical high costs and low public acceptance of novel resource recovery
   scenarios in wastewater treatment, realizing the Biofactory goals
   becomes a difficult task. Decision makers are currently unable to
   appreciate the environmental, social, and economic benefits of the
   Biofactory, as most decision-making tools focus on mainly technical and
   economic aspects. This is the first review is to use bibliometric
   analysis of publication trends in life cycle-based modelling for
   circular economies in wastewater treatment across the globe, focusing on
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Social Life
   Cycle Assessment (SLCA). The integration of LCA, LCC and SLCA for the
   development of a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) decision
   making framework is recommended, while practical implications for the
   methodological development of this tool are compiled. The goal and scope
   of LCSA for the Biofactory must explore multi-product functional units
   for the recovery of different resources from wastewater, where system
   boundaries must include techno-environmental, social and economic
   systems together. Internal loops, feedbacks loops, avoided products and
   co-product allocation methodologies within the integrated system
   boundaries must be considered. Innovation is required for building LCA,
   LCC and SLCA inventories, where life cycle data management is important
   for implementing the Biofactory into the future.},

Abstract = {Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming more ubiquitous, complex and
   powerful as well as more and more present in our daily life. The
   inherent benefit and comfort come with an environmental impact at every
   step of their life-cycle. This impact is significant and unfortunately
   often ignored today. As cyber-physical systems tend to be `invisible',
   there is a need for awareness of the underlying infrastructure and
   required resources, early in the design phases. In this article, the
   environmental impact considerations in the early stages of the
   implementation and opportunities to improve design choices with a
   people-planet-system perspective are discussed. The authors discuss the
   aspects related to system configuration, data management and the overall
   goal and functionalities supported by the CPS. Through a specific smart
   home case, the potential of considering life-cycle assessment of both
   the devices and data management is illustrated. By explicitly
   considering different configurations, it will be possible to analyse the
   environmental impacts of the design decisions. Our research in progress
   targets a design approach to converge into an equilibrium between
   utility, performance, and minor environmental impact of smart systems.},

Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases provide information of fundamental
   importance to the mainstream practice of life cycle assessment (LCA).
   Development and management of LCI data resources is a tremendous task.
   This paper seeks to develop design principles for organizing efforts
   around distributed database management by considering the structure of
   inventory networks.
   A number of LCI databases in wide use are placed into a partial ordering
   using graph theoretic techniques. First, strongly connected components,
   which indicate cyclic dependencies, are identified in each network.
   Then, those components are collapsed to single nodes, rendering the
   graphs acyclic. The acyclic graphs are then ordered topologically.
   Large databases were found to contain a single large strongly connected
   component, designated the background, that satisfied dependencies of
   other processes in the database. Processes with a lower position in the
   ordering than the background, designated the foreground, depended on
   inputs from the background in order to operate, but no background
   processes required inputs from any foreground processes. Processes
   higher in the order than the background, designated the downstream,
   satisfied dependencies in the background but did not themselves require
   the background. Databases sharing a common set of product flows could be
   compared on the basis of their foreground, background, and downstream
   segments.
   Making a distinction between an acyclic foreground and a strongly
   connected background has computational utility because the foreground
   and background databases can be managed independently. Describing LCA
   studies on the basis of their dependence on background product flows
   would allow them to be easily moved among distinct databases that
   provide the same products and would also facilitate critical review.
   Background databases themselves can be broken up by scope into mutually
   dependent systems that can be independently maintained.
   LCI database maintainers should consider maintaining the foreground and
   background components of their databases separately because of the
   differing implications of modeling decisions made in each of the two
   cases. A framework for database-independent enumeration of intermediate
   flows would advance distributed data management.},

Abstract = {Companies represent essential sources of data for Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA). However, management systems and management approaches are rarely
   informed by LCA data developments, and vice-versa. The present paper
   focuses on the role of the company in the LCA data collection process.
   The objective is to investigate the adequacy of the current LCA data
   quality assessment approach from a management perspective. This is
   accomplished by applying the ecoinvent Data Quality System (DQS) to a
   primary LCA data collection project, including an immersion within the
   organisation and taking subjective experiences into account during the
   data collection process. Our analysis relies on two theoretical fields
   in management sciences: first, management tools and second,
   environmental accounting. The study demonstrates that the current
   prevailing LCA data quality assessment approach is inadequate for
   enterprise-specific data because it focuses uniquely on industry average
   data. The study also indicates that LCA constitutes a passive user-based
   tool. Hence, the drawbacks related to data management and control within
   the organisation are completely neglected in LCA developments. Finally,
   our analysis provides concrete suggestions for allowing consistent data
   quality assessment that would ensure the usefulness of LCA information.

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) provides databases that
   agglomerate data provided by companies or states reporting emissions,
   releases, wastes generated, and other activities to meet statutory
   requirements. These databases, often referred to as inventories, can be
   used for a wide variety of environmental reporting and modeling purposes
   to characterize conditions in the United States. Yet, users are often
   challenged to find, retrieve, and interpret these data due to the unique
   schemes employed for data management, which could result in erroneous
   estimations or double-counting of emissions. To address these
   challenges, a system called Standardized Emission and Waste Inventories
   (StEWI) has been created. The system consists of four python modules
   that provide rapid access to USEPA inventory data in standard formats
   and permit filtering and combination of these inventory data. When
   accessed through StEWI, reported emissions of carbon dioxide to air and
   ammonia to water are reduced approximately two- and four-fold,
   respectively, to avoid duplicate reporting. StEWI will greatly
   facilitate the use of USEPA inventory data in chemical release and
   exposure modeling and life cycle assessment tools, among other things.
   To date, StEWI has been used to build the recent USEEIO model and the
   baseline electricity life cycle inventory database for the Federal LCA
   Commons.},

Title = {Leveraging Infrastructure BIM for Life-Cycle-Based Sustainable Road
   Pavement Management},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The latest developments in the field of road asphalt materials and
   pavement construction/maintenance technologies, as well as the spread of
   life-cycle-based sustainability assessment techniques, have posed issues
   in the continuous and efficient management of data and relative
   decision-making process for the selection of appropriate road pavement
   design and maintenance solutions; Infrastructure Building Information
   Modeling (IBIM) tools may help in facing such challenges due to their
   data management and analysis capabilities. The present work aims to
   develop a road pavement life cycle sustainability assessment framework
   and integrate such a framework into the IBIM of a road pavement project
   through visual scripting to automatically provide the informatization of
   an appropriate pavement information model and evaluate sustainability
   criteria already in the design stage through life cycle assessment and
   life cycle cost analysis methods. The application of the proposed
   BIM-based tool to a real case study allowed us (a) to draw
   considerations about the long-term environmental and economic
   sustainability of alternative road construction materials and (b) to
   draft a maintenance plan for a specific road section that represents the
   best compromise solution among the analyzed ones. The IBIM tool
   represents a practical and dynamic way to integrate environmental
   considerations into road pavement design, encouraging the use of digital
   tools in the road industry and ultimately supporting a pavement
   maintenance decision-making process oriented toward a circular economy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Low impact developments (LIDs) are becoming increasingly popular in
   North America as viable solution for sustainable runoff management.
   Although hydrological performance of LIDs in relation to climates is
   readily available, there is still a gap on the evaluation of
   environmental and economic impacts of these infrastructures. We have
   evaluated the cradle-to- site lifecycle environmental and economic
   impacts of four LIDs using a case study of the stormwater management
   system at UBC Okanagan campus in BC, Canada. The environmental impacts
   and costs are determined via ReCiPe, TRACI, and net present value (NPV)
   method, respectively, and incorporated to obtain eco-efficiency of these
   LIDs. We found that the box planter and naturally occurring wetland on
   campus are the best LIDs with lower impacts (approximately 2.5\% of the
   total impacts) than other LIDs. The cost savings from wetland are
   enormous due to zero construction and periodic maintenance after every
   five years. The box planter and wetland occupy the most favorable
   quadrant III of the eco-efficiency matrix whilst, bioswales and rain
   gardens are found in quadrant IV and I, respectively. When compared to
   the constructed wetland, an increase in the economic impacts is found
   without any influence on the eco-efficiency of the overall placement on
   eco-efficiency matrix. The maintenance phase contributes more to
   environmental impacts than the construction, whereas the life cycle cost
   analysis shows the opposite.},

Title = {A flexible multiregional input-output database for city-level
   sustainability footprint analysis in Japan},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding environmental and social footprints at the city level
   through multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis is a key to designing
   policy aimed at mitigating the direct and indirect impacts of a city
   economy on sustainability. However, since the quantity of data required
   is substantial, compiling city-level MRIO tables in Japan and updating
   them yearly involves a huge amount of labor-intensive and time-consuming
   work. The authors have developed a cloud-computing platform called the
   Japan Industrial Ecology Laboratory (IELab) that is highly flexible in
   terms of its sectoral and regional resolution, which enables the user to
   build customized Japanese MRIO tables in accordance with the user's
   specific objectives. The Japan IELab embeds over 145 types of
   statistical information on regional economic activities, including
   input-output tables at the prefecture and city level. These data serve
   as constraints in the optimization process to build a customized MRIO
   table. With IELab, the user can freely select cities, sectors and years
   from 1894 municipalities and 4266 sectors for the years 2005 through
   2016. As a case study, two MRIO tables were built at the prefecture and
   city levels to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the system.
   Their validity was confirmed by comparing results with the original
   statistics. The prefecture-level MRIO table accurately reflected the
   economic structure of Japan's 47 prefectures by identifying
   differentiating prefectural features, distinguishing between, for
   example, manufacturing-oriented and service-oriented prefectures. The
   city-level MRIO table appropriately characterized various economic
   activities and accurately reflected the locational features of a city
   within the prefecture. The role of stakeholders in data management and
   further improvement as well as possible applications of the Japan IELab,
   including life cycle assessment and disaster analysis, are discussed.},

Title = {Topic Taxonomy and Metadata to Support Renewable Energy Digitalisation},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research and innovation in renewable energy, such as wind and solar,
   have been supporting the green transformation of energy systems, the
   backbone of a low-carbon climate-resilient society. The major challenge
   is to manage the complexity of the grid transformation to allow for
   higher shares of highly variable renewables while securing the safety of
   the stability of the grid and a stable energy supply. A great help comes
   from the ongoing digital transformation where digitisation of
   infrastructures and assets in research and industry generates
   multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary digital data. However, a data
   user needs help to find the correct data to exploit. This has two
   significant facets: first, missing data management, i.e., datasets are
   neither findable because of missing community standard metadata and
   taxonomies, nor interoperable, i.e., missing standards for data formats;
   second, data owners having a negative perception of sharing data. To
   make data ready for data science exploitation, one of the necessary
   steps to map the existing data and their availability to facilitate
   their access is to create a taxonomy for the field's topics. For this, a
   group of experts in different renewable technologies such as
   photovoltaics, wind and concentrated solar power and in transversal
   fields such as life cycle assessment and the EU taxonomy for sustainable
   activities have been gathered to propose a coherent and detailed
   taxonomy for renewable energy-related data. The result is a coherent
   classification of relevant data sources, considering both the general
   aspects applicable to electricity generation from selected renewable
   energy technologies and the specific aspects of each of them. It is
   based on previous relevant work and can be easily extended to other
   renewable resources not considered in this work and conventional energy
   technology.},

Title = {Utilization of semantic web technologies to improve BIM-LCA applications},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Currently, designers require to use numerous incomplete data sources and
   make multiple assumptions to conduct an LCA. We argue that traditional
   methods are incapable of addressing LCA data requirements, and for such
   a data and meta-data intensive task, the semantic web is the only
   logical choice of technology. This paper presents a review of the
   semantic web and its applications in the construction industry, along
   with an overview of the current LCA tools. LCA challenges are thoroughly
   discussed, and a framework using the semantic web is developed to
   address the data management issues of BIM-LCA applications. For
   comparison, the implementation is also done using an LCA tool (Tally),
   and a method using Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).
   Results show that the proposed method is superior to RDBMS methods in
   terms of capturing semantics and can improve LCA tools by providing
   reliable data in the early design stages.},

Title = {How Spatial Analysis Can Help Enhance Material Stocks and Flows
   Analysis?},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Spatial information can be integrated into almost all fields of
   industrial ecology. Many researchers have shown that spatial proximity
   affects a variety of behaviors and interactions, and thus matters for
   materials stocks and flows analysis. However, normal tools or models in
   industrial ecology based on temporal dependence cannot be simply applied
   to the case of spatial dependence. This paper proposes a framework
   integrating material stocks and flows analysis with spatial analysis. We
   argue that spatial analysis can help data management and visualization,
   determine spatio-temporal patterns-processes-drivers, and finally
   develop dynamic and spatially explicit models, to improve the
   performance of simulating and assessing stocks and flows of materials.
   Scaling in spatial, temporal, and organizational dimensions and other
   current limitations are also discussed. Combined with spatial analysis,
   industrial ecology can really be more powerful in achieving its origin
   and destination-sustainability.},

Title = {Constraints and opportunities for integrating preparation for reuse in
   the Danish WEEE management system},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In Denmark, the targets of the WEEE Directive are primarily met through
   recycling, even though waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE)
   could be prepared for reuse with increased environmental, economic and
   social benefits. In this study, we investigate the WEEE management
   system as a socio-technical system. Through interviews with 23
   stakeholders, we identify conflicts of interest and technological,
   organisational and institutional constraints for integrating preparation
   for reuse as a management option within the current system. Based on
   this, we identify four main prerequisites for a future integration of
   preparation for reuse. These are: a) extended tendering periods to
   incentivise technological investments; b) the introduction of measures
   to incentivise municipal waste authorities to organise value-conserving
   logistics; c) the introduction of standards and/or guidelines to ensure
   the quality and safety of preparation operations and data management;
   and d) measures to avoid transboundary sales of used EEE. Based on
   transition management theory, we suggest pilot testing and the
   development of niche projects to test new constellations of
   collaboration between actors in the system.},

Title = {Water accounts in decision-making processes of urban water management:
   Benefits, limitations and implications in a real implementation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Data management for decision support is a challenging aspect of any
   decision-making process. Water management is not an exception. The
   objective of this paper is to present a procedure for compiling water
   accounts at an urban level to support political decision-making
   processes with solid foundations. The System of Environmental-Economic
   Accounting for Water (SEEA-Water) was used for this purpose. The case
   study of Santo Domingo de los Colorados in Ecuador serves to illustrate
   the benefits and the limitations of the available data and to identify
   data gaps. The compilation of the SEEA-Water at a local level is a
   pioneering work. The results reveal the water flows (from the
   environment to the economy, within the economy, from the economy to the
   environment), water quality, and the contribution of water resources to
   different economic activities for the period 2014-2015 at the local
   level. The information was categorized for the water supply industry,
   the sewage industry, for the rest of the industries and services, and
   for the households. On the basis of our empirical example, this paper
   shows how SEEA-Water underpins informed decision-making on urban water
   management and serves to improve the quality of water-related data.},

Title = {Addressing water needs of freshwater ecosystems in life cycle impact
   assessment of water consumption: state of the art and applicability of
   ecohydrological approaches to ecosystem quality characterization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2071-2088},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {PurposeIn recent history, human development overbalanced towards
   economic growth has often been accompanied by the degradation and
   reduction of freshwater resources at the expense of freshwater dependent
   ecosystems. For their subsistence and correct functioning, understanding
   environmental water requirements (EWR) represents an area of great
   interest for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and it has been only
   marginally explored. The aim of this paper is to investigate how this
   concept has evolved in ecological and hydrological literature and how it
   can be better integrated in LCIA, to identify potential options for
   improvement of LCIA indicators in the short, mid and long term.MethodsTo
   address the limitations of existing LCIA approaches in modelling EWR,
   four families of EWR methods have been reviewed, namely hydrological,
   hydraulic, habitat simulation and holistic methods. Based on existing
   scientific literature and their broad application, 24 methods have been
   selected and their suitability to be adopted in LCIA has been evaluated
   against nine criteria, with regard to data management issues, accuracy,
   scientific robustness, and potential for future development. A
   semi-quantitative performance score has been subsequently assigned for
   each criterion, showing the main strengths and weaknesses of selected
   methods.Results and discussionThe underlying rationale of the chosen
   approaches is markedly different, likewise the input information needed
   and results applicability. Hydrological methods are well suited for the
   development of global models and they are the only ones currently
   considered in LCIA, although their applicability remains limited to
   water stress indicators. Habitat modelling is identified as an essential
   step for the development of mechanistic LCIA models and endpoint
   indicators. In this respect, hydraulic, habitat simulation and holistic
   methods are fit for the purpose. However, habitat simulation methods
   represent the best compromise between scientific robustness and
   applicability in LCIA. For this reason, a conceptual framework for the
   development of habitat-based characterization factors has been proposed.
   Among the evaluated habitat simulation methods, ESTIMHAB showed the best
   performance and was the method retained for the development of an LCIA
   model that will assess the consequences of water consumption on stream
   ecosystems.ConclusionsThis study identifies the advantages of specific
   modelling approaches for the assessment of water requirements for
   ecosystems. Selected methods could support the development of LCIA
   models at different levels. In the short-term for improving
   environmental relevance of water stress indicators, and in the
   mid/long-term to build up midpoint habitat indicators relating water
   needs of ecosystems with new endpoint metrics.},

Title = {A building information modeling-based carbon emission measurement system
   for prefabricated residential buildings during the materialization phase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {264},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {This study develops a carbon emission measurement system for
   prefabricated residential buildings (PRBs) during the materialization
   phase based on building information modeling (BIM) and a carbon emission
   measurement model. The model is constructed using the carbon emission
   coefficient method. For more accurate measurement, the materialization
   phase of PRBs' carbon cycle is re-defined into five stages (material
   production, material transportation, component production, component
   transportation, and construction). This innovative system also
   incorporates Microsoft Access-based databases for data management. The
   implementation of the system in a PRB project in Shenzhen, China
   revealed that over 90\% of carbon emissions were generated in the
   building material production and construction stages, and overall carbon
   emissions per unit volume of all the prefabricated components were
   764.87 kg/m(3), 20.11\% lower than those of the cast-in-situ parts.
   Compared with results obtained from the traditional method, the system's
   percentage error was 6.52\%, showing good reliability in carbon emission
   measurement. The discrepancy was reasonably justified by inevitable
   material losses and transportation distances. It is concluded that the
   measurement system can accurately predict PRB projects' carbon emissions
   in project planning and early design, identify key areas for carbon
   emission pre-control, and facilitate dynamic management of carbon
   emission reduction during the materialization phase. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Decision making and software solutions with regard to waste management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Material efficiency in lifecycles is a challenge that affects product
   innovators, producers and political stakeholders. The recycling and
   waste management is a direct consequence of this challenge, heavily
   compounded by data requirements. Especially third parties such as
   recyclers, remanufacturers or waste treatment sites face limited
   documentation and data on products. In addition, those actors face
   additional data management challenges due to their distinct upstream
   supply chains of dispersed suppliers and hence due to interrupted
   information flows. This study investigated various software tools to
   critically compare the tool's potential to improve data availability and
   data completeness, as well as the management of the reuse or recycling
   business processes using Enterprise Resource Planning software
   evaluation metrics for each waste-related sub-domain. The main objective
   of this paper is thus to provide a framework for comparison through key
   features, measured adherence to these features and to infer how this
   affects the software landscape. Software packages were sampled using
   public software listings and keyword filters to arrive at a final subset
   of publically accessible software packages, which were then critically
   analysed and compared by feature support. The main results of the
   comparison of these software packages in the discussed waste-related
   sub-domains revealed that data compatibility between packages and
   reporting requirements is the largest issue on a general level. On the
   level of sub-domains, the results showed that software offerings lack
   essential domain-specific features in order to support circular
   lifecycles of products and materials. Secondary results revealed a lack
   of database interoperability and various lesser concerns, such as
   incorrectly reported pricing or obsolescence information. The impact of
   these missing features reinforces the ``silo{''} effect of packages,
   reduces the adoption rate in larger companies, and compounds the problem
   of smaller start-ups and companies using manual paper based solutions
   and lacking reporting capabilities. Publically available databases and
   an increased rate of sharing of information between Original Equipment
   Manufacturers and recyclers would improve the decision-making through
   software solutions in waste-related processing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessment of the pre-combustion carbon capture contribution into
   sustainable development goals SDGs using novel indicators},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The rapid progress in the global population and technical advances have
   resulted in exponential growth in the use of fossil fuels. These are not
   only limited in resources but also have a severe environmental impact.
   The accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), more specifically carbon
   emissions, in the environment has resulted in severe health issues and
   climate changes. The Paris Climate Agreement calls for restricting
   global warming to only 1.5 degrees C by 2050 relative to the
   pre-industrial era. This requires reducing global GHGs emissions as soon
   and as much as possible. Massive efforts are being put into minimizing
   GHG emissions, such as using renewable energy resources and/or using
   carbon capture technologies (CCT). In this study, different CCTs were
   introduced, focusing on the pre-combustion as a promising CCT approach.
   In this work, the role of CCT in realizing the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was thoroughly analyzed and
   discussed. A total of 87 indicators were developed to measure and
   analyze the contribution of CCT to achieving the different SDGs. The
   focus given to the role of the pre-combustion CCT in achieving SDGs is
   being elaborated. The indicators and analysis covered the economic,
   environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development. It was
   found that CCT contributes well to all 17 SDGs, with core and
   substantial contributions to SDG-7 of ``Affordable and clean energy{''},
   and ultimately SDG-13 of ``Climate action{''}. The developed indicators
   would work as a guideline for the different players to ensure that CCT
   is fully adhering the SDGs principles. The proposed indicators have nine
   main benefits, i.e., assist in the achievement of the SDGs, providing
   information for the decision-makers, enhance and benchmark
   sustainability performance, improve risk management, enhance data
   management and reporting practices, improve resource allocation and
   reduce the expenses, improve environmental performance, reduce social
   impact, and improve communications with stakeholder. Moreover, the
   different barriers facing the CCT were presented.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {434-446},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The design of socio-ecological landscapes to provide simultaneously
   multiple benefits has become a key concept in current sustainable
   development thinking and an attractive goal for policy makers. However,
   its application in the practice of landscape management has proved
   difficult. In this study, we develop an approach for practical
   application of landscape design to advance multifunctionality and
   sustainable outcomes. We combine ideas of landscape ecology with methods
   for collaborative decision-making to deal with the practice of designing
   landscapes. Our approach consists of six components including (a)
   definition of boundaries and scales, (b) assessment of local values and
   concerns, (c) knowledge development, (d) stakeholders participation, (e)
   collaborative decision-making and (d) monitoring. We test the approach
   on the case of advanced transport biofuels. These technologies have
   attracted attention in recent years as a means to achieve climate,
   energy and development goals avoiding the environmental and
   socio-economic risks of conventional biofuel technologies. The findings
   suggest that the landscape design approach has the potential to guide
   the planning of complex biofuel projects for sustainable outcomes
   improving local acceptability of potentially controversial projects.},

Title = {A mixed model-based Johnson's relative weights for eco-efficiency
   assessment: The case for global food consumption},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Eco-efficiency composite indicators are widely accepted as the ratio of
   environmental impact to created economic value. These indicators are
   realistic measures for assessing sustainability performance considering
   the economy and environment. The weights reflect the importance of
   indicators to the aggregated environmental impacts. Estimating the
   relative weight of indicators is highly subjective, and therefore the
   search for a single unique weighting method has been going on for years.
   The regression-based weights are one of the most recent trends in
   sustainability modeling. Since these methods are designed initially to
   investigate the impact of multiple variables on a response variable
   rather than to estimate weights, some drawbacks are associated with
   their potential to provide proper weights. This paper presents a novel
   weighting approach integrating linear mixedeffect models with Johnson's
   relative weights to address these drawbacks and provide meaningful
   relative weights for eco-efficiency composite indicators. The proposed
   approach's operational and computational procedures are illustrated
   using a real example, and the eco-efficiency of food consumption of 38
   countries is estimated for the period between 1990 and 2012 using a
   consumption-based sustainability accounting method. The findings have
   shown that energy use and GHG indicators are the most critical
   contributor to global food consumption's environmental impacts. The
   country-based eco-efficiency performance in this work has shown that
   China, India, and Russia are located in the low eco-efficiency score
   class. The Spatio-temporal analysis downgraded the geographical
   location's significance on the trends of eco-efficiency behavior in time
   and space. On the other hand, it revealed the different types of
   emerging hot spots over the world.},
